## Not actively maintained
This project is currently not receiving new features as I am focusing on [HydePHP](https://github.com/hydephp/hyde), however,
the project will continue to get security fixes as long as Laravel 10 is still supported. Open source contributions are welcome!

## Features
* **Highly Customizable:** Turn features on and off in the config
*  **Security Focused CMS:** A CMS for Posts, Users, and Comments with strong and customizable security policies is included out of the box. You can easily update user's permissions as well.
*  **Dark Mode & Mobile Friendly:** A must for the modern app: Dark mode. And of course, all parts of the site are mobile friendly, including the tables in the CMS.
*  **Smart Markdown Editor:** Posts are made using Markdown. To aid in this, the EasyMDE editor is included by default which allows for rich text editing with autosave and markdown previews.
*  **Users & Comments:** Users can create accounts and leave comments. If you want them too. You can even require users to verify their emails to comment.
*  **Semantic and data-rich SEO-minded HTML:** The frontend adheres to follow the practices of Semantic HTML. Blog articles are automatically injected with Open Graph meta tags for better SEO. 

## Full Documentation
Full documentation is available at https://docs.desilva.se/blogkit/. Generated using my free [Laradocgen](https://github.com/caendesilva/laradocgen) package!

## Demos:
Static demo of the default install: https://caendesilva.github.io/laravel-blogkit-static-demo/
Live blog (my own (customized) blog built with this kit): https://blog.desilva.se/

## Get Started
Once you have installed the Laravel app you can use the helper command to create an admin account using `php artisan admin:create` in your terminal.

### How to set up the blog using the demo settings
**Important! This guide is just to demo the site. For production use you must follow the production guide as this guide allows anyone to log in as admin! **

1. Clone the git repo
2. In the config file `config\blog.php` change `demoMode` to `true`
3. In your terminal, run `php artisan migrate --seed`

### How to set up the blog for production
1. Clone the git repo
2. In your terminal, run `php artisan migrate` (Note, if you have previously set up your app using demo data, use `migrate:fresh` to clear demo users instead!)
3. In your terminal, run `php artisan admin:create` and follow the on-screen instructions to create an admin account. Make sure to set a strong password or passphrase!
4. Next, follow the instructions in the [Official Deployment Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/deployment) to ensure you are following the best practices.

#### How to add authors
It may be useful to add more authors to your blog. First, instruct the author to create a standard account. Then, you as admin go to the dashboard and press the "manage" button and check the "Is User Author?" tick and press save.

### Writing blog posts
Blog posts are a breeze to create using the Markdown editor!

#### Good cover images
Each post has a featured cover image that is dynamically cropped using CSS background properties so that it looks smooth in all widths.

For best results, ensure that your cover images are 960 by 640 pixels as that is usually the max size. However, you should also remember that the images are cropped to a much narrower format in many places. Thus you need to make sure that all primary content such as text is contained within the center 640 by 340 pixels.
